Release 1.5.0 (release date: 2012-12-14):
=========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Added subcommands for interacting with snapshots.


Release 1.4.1 (release date: 2012-11-12):
=========================================

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Fixed crash in gcutil when waiting for images to be ready after creation.


Release 1.4.0 (release date: 2012-11-06):
=========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Added a new subcommand, gcutil getserialportoutput, for getting the serial
    port output from an instance.

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Fixed an issue where gcutil waited for instances that failed to be created.

Other Changes:
--------------

  - Changed the zone selection feature to display maintenance information next
    to the zone names.

  - Changed the display of operation resources to show the user responsible for
    the operation.


Release 1.3.4 (release date: 2012-10-11):
=========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Implemented batch adddisk. It is now possible to add multiple disks with a
    single call to gcutil adddisk.

  - Implemented batch delete operations for additional resources. It is now
    possible to delete multiple disks, firewalls, images, instances, networks,
    operations, and snapshots.

  - Added a --format flag for the list subcommands. The flag accepts the
    following values: table, sparse, json, csv, and names. --format=names allows
    gcutil to be used with Unix tool pipelines:

      gcutil listinstances --format=names | xargs gcutil deleteinstance --force

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Fixed the sorting in list subcommands. Instead of sorting each page
    individually, gcutil now sorts all results before displaying them to the
    user.

  - Changed --cache_flag_values to not cache flags when the underlying command
    fails.

Other Changes:
--------------

  - Deprecated --project_id in favor of --project. --project_id still works, but
    will produce a warning.

  - Reconfigured the version checking to take place when gcutil exits.

  - Improved documentation for firewall commands.

  - Removed the --page_token flag.

  - Changed the headings for list and get subcommands. The new headings use
    dashes instead of spaces and are in lower-case. This eliminates the need
    to use quotes with the --sort_by flag and makes the display of the headings
    more user-friendly.


Release 1.2.0 (release date: 2012-08-28):
=========================================

New Features:
-------------

  - Added support for gs:// URLs to the addimage command.

  - Implemented support for multiple flag cache files. gcutil now searches for
    a .gcutil.flags file starting in the current directory, followed by the
    parent directories, and the home directory until a file is found.

Bug Fixes:
----------

  - Added a check to commands dealing with metadata to warn the user of
    duplicate metadata keys instead of silently ignoring duplicates.

  - Fixed an issue where listoperations would not fetch multiple pages when
    encountering an operation that contains an error.

Other Changes:
--------------

  - Changed the way gcutil is packaged.

  - Made some of the flag descriptions and an error messages more informative.
